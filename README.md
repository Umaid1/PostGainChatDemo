This is a test Chat application made for a company, as a prototype that is using 
Parse Framework.

There is some screen size issue for iPhone 6 Splash and some text field, so can be 
adjusted later.

It is multiple peer connected with Parse database onto server and you can create your own
database by changing Client Key and Application Key in AppDelegate file for testing with 
Test Server.
